- **Content Creation**: Generative AI refers to algorithms that can create new content, such as text, images, music, or videos, by learning patterns and structures from existing data. This technology enables applications like chatbots, art generation, and automated writing.

- **Learning Mechanism**: It typically employs techniques like deep learning and neural networks, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformer models, to generate outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content, enhancing creativity and productivity across various fields.
